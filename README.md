# The SQL500 Project

Personal project that holds the Balance, Income, Cashflow and Current Equity Info of every company in the S&P 500. Sourced data from Yahoo Finance (yfinance) into a PostgreSQL Database.

Ongoing models/financial strength tests can then be performed against all companies at once where data is available.
